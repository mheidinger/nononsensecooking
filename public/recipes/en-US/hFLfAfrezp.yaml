steps:
  - The given amounts are assuming that you eat the salad as a side dish
  - Slice the carrots diagonally, then cut the slices into thin sticks
  - Cut thin slices off of the red cabbage. If the pieces are too large for your liking, feel free to chop them up further
  - Chop the leek into rings diagonally
  - Add the rest of the ingredients to the carrots, cabbage and leek and mix them thoroughly
  - The salad tastes best after being left in the refrigerator for a day, but you definitively also enjoy it immediately after preparing it :)
